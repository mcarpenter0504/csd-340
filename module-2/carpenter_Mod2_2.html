        <p class="intro">
            <span class="sentence">Hello! My name is Madilyn Carpenter, and I am from St. Louis, MO.</span> 
            I graduated from Marquette High School in 2023 with a fairly large class. Missouri is one of my favorite states since it has all four seasons!</p>

<p>Currently, I’m working full-time in a software development role. I primarily do backend work on a team of 10. However, I have also created a few React websites for some POCs.</p>

<p>Family-wise, both my parents are separated and have remarried. I also have a 5-year-old half-brother who is very energetic. With both families combined, I have four dogs.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a boyfriend who I have been with for about four years now. He is my best friend and my favorite person in the world. We are currently in the market for our first home; however, it is pretty difficult with the housing market and both of us paying for school.</p>
